# **Student Grades Tracker**

## **1. Application Overview** 
**üìù A simple menu-based application to manage student grades using linked lists**  
The **Student Grades Tracker** is an application designed to help instructors manage student records, including names, ID numbers, and grades. The program allows users to add, view, search, sort, save and delete student data efficiently.  

### **üéØ Project Overview**  
This is a **C program** that helps teachers or administrators keep track of student grades. You can:  
‚úÖ Add new students with their grades  
‚úÖ View all student records  
‚úÖ Search for specific students  
‚úÖ Update grades when needed  
‚úÖ Sort students by name, ID, or average score  
‚úÖ Save all data to a file (grades won't be lost when program closes)  



### **Purpose**  
- Track and manage student grades in a structured way.  
- Calculate average grades for performance analysis.  
- Store and retrieve student records.

## **2. Data Representation & Structure**  


### **Data Structure**  
- A **linked list** of `Student` structs to store all student records.  
- Enables efficient addition, searching,viewing and sorting.  
### **How Student Data is Stored**  
```c
struct Student {
    char name[50];         // Student name
    int id;                // Student ID 
    int grades[5];         // Array of 5 grades
    struct Student* next;  // Link to next student
};
```
- Uses **linked lists** (flexible size, no wasted memory)  
- Fixed **5 grades per student** (simple to manage)

## **3. How to Use the Program**  

### **Main Menu Options**  
```
1. ADD STUDENT
2. VIEW ALL STUDENTS
3. SEARCH STUDENT
4. UPDATE GRADES
5. CALCULATE AVERAGE
6. SORT STUDENTS
7. SAVE TO FILE
8. LOAD FROM FILE
9. EXIT
```

## **4. Technical implementation**

  
 ### Key Features
- **Linked List Storage**: Students stored as nodes (flexible size, no wasted memory).

- **File Handling**: Auto-saves/loads data to students.txt (plain text format).

- **Search & Update**: Finds students by ID/name and edits grades.

- **Sorting**: Uses selection sort (by name, ID, or average grade).

- **Averages**: Calculates and displays each student‚Äôs mean score.

### How It Works
- **Adding Students**: New entries go to the end of the linked list.

- **Saving/Loading**: Reads/writes to a file to keep data after closing.

- **Sorting**: Rearranges nodes by comparing names, IDs, or grades.

- **Memory**: Uses malloc/free to manage dynamic data.

## **5. Expected Outcome**  
A functional, user-friendly program that simplifies grade tracking for educators while demonstrating core C programming concepts (structs, file I/O, sorting, and dynamic memory).

#### For Teachers:

‚úÖ Add/view/edit grades easily.

‚úÖ Sort students by performance.

‚úÖ Data saved automatically.

#### For Developers:

‚úÖ Demonstrates structs, pointers, file I/O, sorting.

‚úÖ Simple but functional (no GUI).

‚úÖ  Easy to expand (e.g., add more subjects).
